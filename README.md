The purpose of this package is to maintain auto-generated ics files from various sources in the `data/` subfolder. 
For example, the build script will use a source ics file for french non working days, will translate the summaries 
of each events, compute list of easter dates for the next years and save the resulting ics file in the `build/` 
subfolder, one file per language.
